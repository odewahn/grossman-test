<section xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" id="using_irb" data-type="appendix"><h1>Using irb</h1><p>Oftentimes while programming, you will wonder about the syntax of a
  command or how something works in Ruby. Creating a new file and running it
  is the wrong option in many cases because it wastes a lot of time.</p><p><code>irb</code> is Ruby’s interactive
  interpreter (short for Interactive Ruby). This is a great tool that you will
  want to learn to use, as it will greatly speed up time spent debugging code.
  We also use it throughout the book to give examples.</p><p>To run <code>irb</code>, first open a
  terminal.</p><p>In Windows, you can do this by opening the Start menu and clicking on
  Run. A small window will appear with a text box. Type <code>cmd</code> and hit Return. A black-and-white window that
  has a blinking cursor will open. Welcome to the terminal.</p><p>On a Mac, the Terminal is located in Applications→Utilities.</p><p>Type <code>irb</code> in the terminal to launch
  <code>irb</code>. When it launches, you will be
  greeted with a prompt to enter your first line of code:</p><pre id="pro_id00072" data-type="programlisting" data-code-language="ruby">irb(main):001:0&gt;</pre><p>To exit, either type <code>exit</code> or hit
  Ctrl-D. This is a terminating condition that allows you to exit most
  programs.</p></section>
