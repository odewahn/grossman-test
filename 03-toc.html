<p>Activity-Based Learning Ruby</p>

<p>Learn how to program in Ruby and get exposed to computer science principles and techniques along the way.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll get exposed to concepts when they&rsquo;re needed and ensure you understands those concepts before moving on and building on your knowledge. You&rsquo;ll start out being an active participant in building your own Blackjack card game by writing, testing, and running code as part of the experience without having to install a Ruby environment.</p>

<p>After completion, you&rsquo;ll have the skills to solve problems and use algorithms with elegance and inspiration rather than simply plowing ahead with brute force. So when faced with a new problem, you will not just throw up your hands, you will have a methodical approach to solving it.</p>

<p>Key Activities:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Talking to the user with Ruby -- the puts command.&nbsp; We'll use this to prompt the user for the decisions needed during a game of blackjack.
	<ul>
		<li><strong>puts command</strong></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Listening to the user.&nbsp; We have to be able to receive input.&nbsp; We'll do this with gets.
	<ul>
		<li><strong>gets command</strong></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Deciding what to do next.&nbsp; We need to use an IF-THEN statement to decide if we should keep playing or not.
	<ul>
		<li><strong>variables</strong></li>
		<li><strong>assigning a value to a variable</strong></li>
		<li><strong>if then else</strong></li>
		<li><strong>if then</strong></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Dealing Cards:&nbsp; We have to define a card object and and populate the cards with all their numbers and all their suits.
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Arrays</strong></li>
		<li><strong>using objects</strong></li>
		<li><strong>initializing objects</strong></li>
		<li><strong>objects, what are they</strong></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Deciding on HIT or STAND for the dealer.&nbsp; We now need a DEALER object to decide if we take a HIT or STAND based on the rules of black jack. &nbsp;
	<ul>
		<li>&nbsp;</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Keeping track of the player's score during a game.&nbsp; We need a PLAYER object to keep track of all the cards the player has.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>Updating the Scoreboard.&nbsp; Once a hand of blackjack is over, we need to update how much money the player has or how many games the player has won.&nbsp; We need a SCOREBOARD object for this.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Storing the results of the game to a file.&nbsp; If we want to stop playing for a while and keep track of the game status we need a FILE to do this so we have to learn how to open and WRITE to a file.
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Write to File</strong></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Reading the existing game file.&nbsp; To restore status we need to READ from the file we just created.
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Read from File</strong></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
