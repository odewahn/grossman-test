<h1>BlackJack Rules</h1>

<p>The game is to get a total of 21 without going over.&nbsp; Aces count as one or eleven.&nbsp; Face cards count as 10.&nbsp; Dealer deals a card to you and to the dealer.&nbsp; Your card is secret and dealer card is visible.&nbsp; You decide to HIT or STAND.&nbsp; If you HIT, dealer deals you another card.&nbsp; You then decide again.&nbsp; As long as you choose HIT you get another card.&nbsp; If a card takes your total over 21, the game ends and the dealer wins.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Once you stand at a value under 21, the dealer decision is fixed. With a total of 16 or under, the dealer takes a HIT, otherwise with a total of 17 or over, the dealer stands.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Once the dealer stands the dealer total is compared to the player total.&nbsp;&nbsp; If its a tie, the game ends in a tie.&nbsp; If the dealer total is higher than the player, the dealer wins.&nbsp; If the dealer total is less than the player, the player wins.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lets say the dealer deals you an ACE.&nbsp; The dealer then gets a KING so at this point you have 1 or 11 and the dealer has 10.&nbsp; You then get a 5.&nbsp; At this point your total is 5 or 16&nbsp; as the ace can be one or eleven.&nbsp;&nbsp; Dealer gets an 8 for a total of 18.&nbsp; You then choose hit as you don't have much to lose.&nbsp; Dealer gives you a 4.&nbsp; You now have 20 so you stand.&nbsp; Your 20 beats the dealers 18 and you win.&nbsp;</p>
