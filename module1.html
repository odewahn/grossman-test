<h1>Module 1 - Display a Welcome Message</h1>

<p>We want to make a game of blackjack.&nbsp; We will get into the rules later, but for now its a card game and we have to figure out how to program a computer and tell it how to play the game.&nbsp;&nbsp; Computers understand programming languages and we have chosen Ruby as we think its a good one to get people started.&nbsp; So now we have to tell you how to talk to the computer using Ruby.&nbsp; We have to be precise and if we mis-spell a word, well the computer is not going to understand it.</p>

<p>We want to display a welcome message. The command to do this is <strong>puts </strong>which is a shortened name for <strong>put string.&nbsp; </strong></p>

<p>Strings are sequences of characters or numbers that can be displayed on a screen or written to a file or printed on a printer.&nbsp; You cannot add two strings together or divide by them.&nbsp; Think about it:&nbsp; 4 divided by 2 makes sense.&nbsp; &quot;A&quot; divided by &quot;B&quot; doesn't.&nbsp; In many programming languages, double quotes (&quot;) are used to indicate that something is a string.</p>

<p>So now it's time to do it:</p>

<p>Type:<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<pre class="pre " data-code-language="ruby" data-executable="true" data-type="programlisting">
puts &quot;Welcome to Black Jack&quot;
</pre>

<p>inside of an environment that lets you enter Ruby commands.</p>

<p>You should see the message:&nbsp; Welcome to Black Jack.</p>

<p>In many programming languages books, the first thing they tell you to do is have the computer says HELLO WORLD.&nbsp;&nbsp; To do that we just use the same puts command:</p>

<pre class="pre " data-type="programlisting">
puts &quot;Hello World.&quot;
</pre>

<p>Now that we showed you how to do it and you have it working, its a good time to show you the kinds of things that can go wrong when writing programs.</p>

<p>Change your <strong>puts </strong>command to <strong>put</strong> as in:</p>

<pre class="pre " data-type="programlisting">
put &quot;Welcome to Black Jack&quot;
</pre>

<p>You'll get the following (which should send confusing thoughts to your brain and make you less sure that learning how to program is going to be so fun).&nbsp;&nbsp; Trust us, its an awesome feeling when you get something to work that you thought at the start that you might not be able to get it work.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="p1"><strong>NoMethodError: undefined method `put' for main:Object</strong></p>

<p>You'll get a nice message of &quot;NoMethodError: undefined method for put&quot;. &nbsp; It is amazing anyone thinks computers are so smart.&nbsp; &nbsp; People are far more resilient.&nbsp; One little character. &nbsp;</p>

<p>It is annoying that computers have to always care about every last little letter. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lets take this error message piece by piece.</p>

<p>Well first it tells you the type of error you have followed by a colon. &nbsp;In this case you have a <strong>NoMethodError</strong>. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Well it turns out a <em>method</em> is piece of code that you might want to repeat. &nbsp;Terrific name isn't it. &nbsp; We will talk about this more later.&nbsp; Some languages call it a <em>function</em> based on the mathmatical definition of a function.&nbsp;&nbsp; In Math and in Computer Science, functions are used to make life easier to express equations. &nbsp; A simple function is <strong>f(x) = x + 2</strong>.&nbsp; This means whenever we send the <strong>f&nbsp;</strong> function a value for <strong>x, </strong>we want it to return a value that adds two to the value we sent.&nbsp; So if we ask for f(4), the result of the function is 6.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Anyway, &nbsp;you simplify your computer programs with methods and we'll get to all that later. &nbsp;We just wanted you to know its a thing that comes in handy to make it so you don't have to write the same programming code over and over.</p>

<p>So Ruby has a way to make it so you can define new methods. &nbsp;When you entered <strong>puts</strong>, that referenced a method that was written by the people who invented Ruby and its job is to output the string that follows to the screen.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>When you got rid of the <em>s</em> in <em><strong>puts </strong></em>and just entered <strong>put</strong>, the ruby interpreter (the thing that processes each Ruby command) decided you must have written a new method called <strong>put.&nbsp; </strong>It looked for it and couldn't find it and gave you a <strong>NoMethodError. </strong></p>

<p>Now fix your PUT to PUTS and get it to work again. &nbsp; What a relief that is.</p>

<p>Ready for one more typo and its impact?</p>

<p>Lets get rid of the double quotes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>so your code will now look like</p>

<pre class="pre " data-type="programlisting">
puts Welcome to Blackjack
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
Now you get a new error message

<p class="p1"><strong>NameError: undefined local variable or method `blackjack' for main:Object</strong></p>

<p>Well now the Ruby interpreter says you entered PUTS correctly so it was thinking you would follow it with a nice <strong>string. </strong>&nbsp; With quotes, the string has a value that is inside of the quotes, without quotes the string is assumed to be in a variable.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When you took off the quotes around <em>Welcome to blackjack</em> -- ruby thought you were referring to a variable named <em>WELCOME</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp; We never defined this variable so it then said <strong>undefined local variable</strong>. &nbsp;</p>
We showed you these two error messages for a reason. So if you end up getting one, you will have seen it before and you will know that probably it is some small issue that you have mistyped something.&nbsp; Sometimes you won't find the error because its a little like looking for spelling errors in your own e-mails (without a spell checker).&nbsp; You don't see the mistake because you are thinking you got it right.&nbsp; Sometimes it helps to take a break, go do something else for a few minutes, come back and look for the error again.

<p>Also, remember everything you type into a program should make sense to you.&nbsp; Don't just type something because its in a book or someone told you to do it, make sure it makes sense before you type it and you know what you are trying to accomplish.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So fix the program you have written and we are ready to move on and get this game working.&nbsp;</p>

<pre class="pre " data-type="programlisting">
puts Welcome to Blackjack&quot;
</pre>
