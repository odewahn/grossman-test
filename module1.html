<h1>Module 1 - Display a Welcome Message</h1>

<p>We want to make a game of blackjack.&nbsp; We will get into the rules later, but for now its a card game and we have to figure out how to program a computer and tell it how to play the game.&nbsp;&nbsp; Computers understand programming languages and we have chosen Ruby as we think its a good one to get people started.&nbsp; So now we have to tell you how to talk to the computer using Ruby.&nbsp; We have to be precise and if we mis-spell a word, well the computer is not going to understand it.</p>

<p>We want to display a welcome message. The command to do this is <strong>puts </strong>which is a shortened name for <strong>put string.&nbsp; </strong></p>

<p>Strings are sequences of characters or numbers that can be displayed on a screen or written to a file or printed on a printer.&nbsp; You cannot add two strings together or divide by them.&nbsp; Think about it:&nbsp; 4 divided by 2 makes sense.&nbsp; &quot;A&quot; divided by &quot;B&quot; doesn't.&nbsp; In many programming languages, double quotes (&quot;) are used to indicate that something is a string.</p>

<p>So now it's time to do it:</p>

<p>Type:<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<pre class="pre" data-code-language="ruby" data-executable="true" data-type="programlisting">
puts &quot;Welcome to Black Jack&quot;
</pre>

<p>inside of an environment that lets you enter Ruby commands.</p>

<p>You should see the message:&nbsp; Welcome to Black Jack.</p>

<p>In many programming languages books, the first thing they tell you to do is have the computer says HELLO WORLD.&nbsp;&nbsp; To do that we just use the same puts command:</p>

<pre class="pre " data-type="programlisting">
puts &quot;Hello World.&quot;
</pre>
