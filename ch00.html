<section xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" id="preface" data-type="preface"><h1>Preface</h1><p>Computer science introductory texts are often unnecessarily long. Many
  exceed 500 pages, laboriously describing every nuance of whatever
  programming language they are using to introduce the concepts.</p><p>There is a better way: a programming language that has a low entry
  barrier. Preferably, the language selected should be a real, widely used
  language with a subset that is powerful and useful, yet mercifully small.
  Such a choice should arm the readers with marketable tools. The esoteric
  details of the programming language, however, should be ignored but with
  pointers for future investigation provided.</p><p>Ruby is a programming language well suited to this task. It is
  object-oriented, interpreted, and relatively straightforward. More so,
  instead of being purely educationally oriented, its popularity in industry
  is steadfastly growing.</p><p>Our book should be covered in sequential fashion. Each chapter assumes
  that the material from the preceding chapters has been mastered. To focus
  the discussion, we ignore gory details, such as user interface design and
  development issues, that we believe are ancillary to the core of computer
  science. Such issues should be, and are, covered in depth in a variety of
  subsequent courses.</p><p>Our target audience is students and practitioners who wish to learn
  computer science using Ruby rather than just how to program in a given
  language. This book consistently emphasizes why computer science is
  different from computer programming. Students and practitioners must
  understand what an algorithm is and what differentiates differing algorithms
  for the same task. Although we are living in an era of growing computational
  resources, we are also living in a world of growing data sets. Data amass
  every day; thus, efficient algorithms are needed to process these
  data.</p><p>Students and practitioners completing a course using this book possess
  foundational knowledge in the basics of computer science and are prepared to
  master abstract and advanced concepts. Second semester courses should rely
  on languages other than Ruby, furthering the understanding that programming
  languages are just interchangeable, expressive tools. We know, however, that
  many students and practitioners may not take another computer science
  course. If that is the case, this book provides them with an overview of the
  field and an understanding of at least one popular programming language that
  happens to be useful from both a practical and a pedagogical
  standpoint.</p><p>Concepts taught in this book provide students and practitioners with a
  sufficient foundation to later learn more complex algorithms, advanced data
  structures, and new programming languages.</p><p>Finally, we hope to instill a core appreciation for algorithms and
  problem solving so students and practitioners will solve problems with
  elegance and inspiration rather than simply plowing ahead with brute
  force.</p><p>The slides corresponding to this book and the source code listed in

    use the code in your programs and documentation. You do not need to
    contact us for permission unless you’re reproducing a significant portion
    of the code. For example, writing a program that uses several chunks of
    code from this book does not require permission. Selling or distributing a
    CD-ROM of examples from O’Reilly books does require permission. Answering
    a question by citing this book and quoting example code does not require
    permission. Incorporating a significant amount of example code from this
    book into your product’s documentation does require permission.</p><p>We appreciate, but do not require, attribution. An attribution

    are everywhere” or “computers are a commodity.” Clearly, computers are
    everywhere, are used by everyone, and permeate every daily function and
    activity. Unfortunately, the majority of society can only use ready-made
    computer applications; they cannot <em>program</em> computers.
    With this book, we intend to change that!</p><p>In authoring this book, a five-year process, we benefited from and
    are grateful for the help of many; here we name but a few and apologize to
    those whose help we inadvertently forgot to acknowledge by name.</p><p>We thank all the students who persevered through the many
    instantiations of this text, from those who read the initial chapters over
    and over and over again as part of IIT’s offerings. Their comments,
    suggestions, and criticisms guided our corrections through the
    iterations.</p><p>The entire production of this book, from the first partial drafts to
    the final version delivered to O’Reilly, was managed by two students,
    initially by Yacin Nadji (a doctoral student at Georgia Tech) and more
    recently by Andrew Yates (a doctoral student at Georgetown University).
    Without their help, we would have stumbled over one another, and we would
    have given up the effort many times over.</p><p>We use and envision others will use our book in the classroom. To
    aid instruction, we provide corresponding slides that would not exist
    without the help of two Georgetown University students, Candice Penelton
    and Sarah Chang.</p><?hard-pagebreak?><p>We benefited from many editorial remarks; we thank the editorial
    changes suggested by Becca Page, the anonymous reviewers, and most
    notably, Mike Fitzgerald, who not only reviewed the book word by word, but
    also tested our code. We also thank Jason Soo for his periodic assistance
    with the Ruby source code and Abdur Chowdhury for his general guidance and
    assistance. Likewise, we thank the entire O'Reilly production team, who
    went way beyond what could be expected and significantly improved this
    book.</p><p>Finally and foremost, we thank our family members whose support and
    tolerance helped us through our jointly endured struggles (for David: Mary
    Catherine, Isaac, and Joseph; for Gideon: Dalia; and for Ophir:
    Nazli).</p></section></section>
